able to make a natural state model

Learnings:
decreased the reservoir permeability from 1E-14 to 5E-15 and increasing horizontal permeability of upflow made the model converge to natural state.
increased res perm to 8E-15 and still converging

able to create NS comparison plots for matching
To do: improve match

Model_1: 
increased upflow to -12, increased uflow horizontal perm, decreased reservoir perm to 6E-15

fixed the preNS state by removing the temperature gradient initialization

got elevation contours from: https://philgis.org/
used QGIS to extract a raster from the contour, used grid interpolation, inverse distance weighing algorithm, radius=2000
extracted elevation contours
remove nodes that are above the model to extract elevations

Model_1b new model to add elevations up to 2000maSL

inactive blocks should be atmosphere blocks instead to fix the temperatures in the 'top' of the model
able to reach natural state again

plot the pcp and compare with simulated
lowered down reservoir permeability to attain lower simulated pressure values
Model_1c: best NS model so far :D

able to plot multiple simulated runs

Model_1e, copied from Model_1d, increased the reservoir area in the northern region to lower pressure and temp in KL area.

Difference in pressures should be related to the elevations(overburden and water table)  of the well location, i.e. the
try model_1g, different grid, mas masinsin in NW direction ****** this didnt work

Scrap model_1g, use Model_1f still best

increased permeability of upflow path in Model_1f to decrease overall pressure

added the nodes in 'sides' of model to be top_zones. I hope this will prevent pressures lower than 1 bar
heightening the permeability value of 'top' to 1E-15 prevented pressures lower than 1bar
note: co2_gas in paraview is the  Super-Critical/Liquid CO2 Saturation, co2_aq is Gas CO2 saturation

in papers from Garapati, et.al. the well spacing is only 707m

Model_2c - add in constant co2 flow rate to atmosphere and top layer *this fixes the small timesteps and long simulations :D
paraview - perm X is the porosity :((
